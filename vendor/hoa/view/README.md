# Hoa\View ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/View)

This library defines a view interface: `Hoa\View\Viewable`.

A view is defined by 4 methods:

  * `getOutputStream`: Where to write the view,
  * `getData`: What data we have,
  * `render`: To run the rendering,
  * `getRouter`: How do we locate resources and other documents.

That's all.

## Installation

With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into your
dependencies, you need to require
